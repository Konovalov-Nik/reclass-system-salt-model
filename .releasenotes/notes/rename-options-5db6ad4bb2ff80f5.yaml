summary: >
  change OS-cloud credentials defining process

upgrades:
   * 'cacert_path' and 'cafile' variables for Security Audit and Cleanup services were changed to:

     .. code-block:: yaml
        security_monkey_openstack:
          source_credentials: source/path/for/os/credentials/on/env
          service_credentials: path/to/os/credentials/in/service/container

        janitor_monkey_openstack:
          source_credentials: source/path/for/os/credentials/on/env
          service_credentials: path/to/os/credentials/in/service/container

     Now you do not need to specify cert-file properly, need to define directory only.
     Cert-file named 'cert.pem' by default for all services.
     'source_credentials' equal to 'oss_openstack_credentials_path'.

   * 'oss_openstack_cert_path' was changed to:

     .. code-block:: yaml

        oss_openstack_credentials_path: source/path/for/os/credentials/on/env

   .. code-block:: text

      Changes affect cluster and system levels.
